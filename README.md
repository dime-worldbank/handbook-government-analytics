# handbook-government-analytics
This repository complements the handbook "Government Analytics: Methodological Advances in Understanding Public Administration", published by the World Bank with Daniel Rogger  (World Bank) and Christian Schuster (University College London) as co-editors. It is aimed to provide further assistance to policy practitioners and public administration scholars, by enabling them to access R Scripts, Stata .do files and other relevant materials related to the handbook. The files are grouped by chapter and allow for replication of the results and/or access to interactive toolkits.
